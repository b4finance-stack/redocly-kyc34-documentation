## 📄 Overview

The **Documents** section is fully customizable.

- **Standard documents** are integrated by default at installation.  
- You can **manually add** documents specific to each file.  
- You can also **download all documents attached to the record**.

## 🗑️ Deleting an envelope

> ⚠️ **Prerequisite:** The envelope must be empty before deletion.

Before sending the file to the counterparty, you can **delete a document envelope**.  
When the envelope no longer contains files, the **trash icon becomes active** and allows deletion.

This prevents the counterparty from being blocked by documents:
- that are not relevant to them, or  
- that are not needed for their case.

---

## 🤝 Shared documents

**Shared documents** are visible to **all users**, including the **counterparty**, through their **completion link**.

---

## 🔒 Internal documents

**Internal documents** are visible only to the **operator**.

---

## 💼 Special case - Investor counterparty

When the **“MiFID Letter”** option is enabled:
- The letter is automatically **stored in the investor's internal documents**.

---

**💡 Tip:**
Use filters or document statuses to better distinguish **internal**, **shared**, and **required** items when configuring a file.
