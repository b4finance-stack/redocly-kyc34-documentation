# MiFID

The **MiFID letter** is sent to inform the investor of their **MiFID categorization**.

---

## Sending conditions
It is sent to the **investor** and the **file owner** only in the following two cases:

1. **At first approval** of the file  
   → A letter is automatically **generated and sent**.

2. **At re-approval** of an already approved file 
   → If the **categorization has changed** since the previous approval.

---

## Sending method
It is sent **by email**.  
The message content and attachment rely on a **customizable template**, allowing communication to be adapted per client.
