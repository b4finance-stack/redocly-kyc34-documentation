## 🧾 Data exports for counterparties and operations

The **Data Export** module lets you **generate automated reports** for two main categories:

- **Counterparties**  
- **Operations**

These exports make it easier to monitor, verify, and archive information related to your activities.

## 🧍‍♀️ Counterparty export

The **counterparty export** is done **by date range**.

### ▶️ Steps to follow:
1. Select the **desired period** (dates correspond to each counterparty file's **creation date**).  
2. Click **“Run export”**.  
3. Once the report is generated, a **notification email** is sent automatically.  
4. The email contains a **direct download link** for the requested report.

> 💡 The export includes all counterparties created during the selected period, with their main metadata (status, date, type, etc.).

## 🔁 Operations export

The operations export follows the same logic as counterparty export, with one difference:

- You must provide **signature dates** or **approval dates**,  
  depending on the selected export type.

> 📅 Example: to get operations signed between October 1 and October 31, enter those two dates in the filter fields.

## 🧠 Best practices

To export **all your data**, regardless of category:

- Use a **wide date range**, for example:  
  `from 01/01/2020 to today`.

> 🔐 This lets you retrieve the full history available since **your environment was opened**, without data loss.

> 💡 *The Data Export module is designed to provide fast, reliable, and secure extraction of operational and regulatory data.*
