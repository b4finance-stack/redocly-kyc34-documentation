# Periodic review

## Periodic review (Remediation)

**Periodic review**, also called *remediation*, is the process of **regularly updating** investor files (distributors, service providers, etc.).  
It ensures that collected information and documents remain **compliant with regulatory requirements** and **AML/CFT obligations**.

On the platform, the **next review date** is visible directly in the **investor file**.

## How the review date is calculated

The **next review date** is automatically determined based on two criteria:

1. The **file approval date** (first approval or most recent approval).  
2. The **AML risk level** assigned to the file.

👉 **The higher the risk, the more frequent the review.**

## Default review intervals

| Risk level | Review frequency |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Low           | Every **3 years** |
| Medium            | Every **2 years** |
| High / High +  | Every **1 year**  |

These settings are **configurable**: each client can customize review intervals directly in their environment **settings**.

## 🆕 Manual entry of approval date (paid option)

In addition to automatic calculation, the platform provides a **manual option** to **enter or modify the approval date directly**.

This is useful in cases such as:

- Exceptional regularization.  
- External audit/control.  
- Actual date differs from automatic calculation.

Once entered, this **manual date becomes the new reference** for future review date calculations.

{% admonition type="warning" %}
This feature is a **paid option**.  
Contact your administrator or support team to enable it.
