# 👩‍💼 Operator access

**Operator access** allows users to view all subscriptions (depending on granted permissions), monitor their progress, and access investors' **KYC** records.

The operator can act at different levels:

- As **subscription owner**  
- As an **analyst**, in charge of follow-up  
- As an **approver**, authorized to validate or reject a subscription

Each subscription follows a defined path, from creation to final signature.

## 📂 Available modules

Two modules are available for subscription management:

- **Subscription monitoring**: lets you view all subscriptions, whether direct or indirect (those owned by a distributor).  
- **Subscriptions**: lets you view only direct-sale subscriptions and create new subscriptions as an operator.

## 🧩 Creating a subscription

### Step 1: Open the module

To create a new subscription:

1. Go to the **Direct Sales** module.  
2. Click **Add subscription**.

---

### Step 2: Fill in basic information

A first modal window opens to enter the main subscription information.

#### ⚠️ Create or select an investor

- If you type an investor name **without autocomplete**, a **new investor is automatically created** in the *Diligence* module.  
- If you use **autocomplete**, you can select an existing investor and directly link the subscription.

💡 The search engine provides suggestions from the first letters entered.

### Step 3: Complete and send the subscription questionnaire

After validating step one, you are redirected to the **subscription questionnaire**.

To share the subscription with the investor, **two fields are mandatory** for the operator:

- Investor **email address**  
- **Entry fees**

Once this information is entered, the **Share** button (top-right) becomes available.

Information in the **Investor** and **Suitability** sections is copied to the *Diligence* record and is **shared across all funds**.  
Information in the **Subscription** section is **fund-specific** and can be customized independently.

---

### Step 4: Preview the form

Before sending, you can **preview the subscription form** using the **Other actions** button or by going to the **Finalize** step.

## 🔄 Take control back of a subscription

When the subscription status is **“sent to investor”**, it means:

- The signature process **has not started yet**  
- The investor **currently controls the file** but has not clicked **Sign** yet

➡️ In this case, you can **take control back** by clicking the dedicated button in the top-right corner.

---

# 👤 Subscription for an existing investor

As explained above, you can link a **new subscription** to an **existing investor**.

In most cases, this investor's **KYC** record is already **Approved**.

The **Investor** and **Suitability** sections then appear as **validated** and **read-only** (greyed out).

## ✏️ Update investor record

If you want to update the investor record:

1. Click **Edit investor**.  
2. Fields become editable again.  
3. The record status automatically returns to **Collecting**.

---

## 👤 Investor access - Complete subscription information

After receiving the **completion and signature link**, the investor must fill in **all required fields (\*)**.

This information is needed to:

- either **send the data back to the operator** for verification,  
- or **sign the subscription directly** at the end of the flow.
