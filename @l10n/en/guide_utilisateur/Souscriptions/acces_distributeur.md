# 👥 Distributor access


---

## 🎯 Overview

**Distributor access** provides full visibility over:
- investor **subscriptions**,  
- the distributor's **client portfolio**,  
- and the distributor's **own agreements**.

> ⚠️ This access is **restricted**:  
> - the distributor **cannot edit or approve** KYC records,  
> - but can **create new subscriptions**, for existing or new investors.

## 📝 Creating a subscription

### Step 1 - Open the module
To create a new subscription:
1. Go to the **Subscriptions** module.  
2. Click **Add subscription**.

---

### Step 2 - Fill in basic information
A modal window opens to enter the **main subscription information**.

#### ⚠️ Create or select an investor
- If you type an investor name **without autocomplete**, a **new investor** is automatically created.  
- If you use **autocomplete**, you can select an **existing investor** and directly link the subscription.  
  > The search engine provides suggestions from the first letters typed.

### Step 3 - Complete and send the subscription questionnaire
After validating basic information, you are redirected to the **subscription questionnaire**.

To share the subscription with the investor, **two fields are mandatory** for the distributor:
- the investor **email address**,  
- the **entry fees**.

Once these fields are filled in, the **“Share” button** (top-right) becomes available.

Before sending, you can **preview the subscription form**:
- Go to the **Finalize** step to view the document preview before signature.

## 🔄 Take control back of a subscription

When a subscription is in **“sent to investor”** status, it means:
- the **signature process** has not started yet,  
- and the investor controls the file but **has not clicked “Sign”** at the end of their flow.

> 🧭 In this case, you can **take control back of the subscription** by clicking the dedicated button in the **top-right** corner.

**Note:**  
An operator with visibility on the file can also **take over the subscription** and resend it.

---

## 🔁 Subscription for an existing investor

As described earlier, you can **link a new subscription** to an **existing investor**.

In most cases:
- the investor's **KYC** record is already in **Approved** status,  
- the **Investor** and **Suitability** sections then appear as **validated**.
{% img src="../images/Souscriptions/acces_distributeur/image40.png" alt="Investor selection" width="1100" withLightbox=true /%}
These sections are displayed in **read-only mode (greyed out)**.

### Updating an investor record
1. Click **Edit investor**.  
2. Fields become **editable** again.  
3. The record status automatically returns to **Collecting**.

## 🔐 Investor access - Complete the subscription

After receiving the **completion and signature link**, the investor must:
- fill in **all required fields** (*),
- so the file can either:
  - be **sent back to the operator** for review,  
  - or be **signed directly** at the end of the flow.
