# 🧩 Create multiple subscriptions for one investor


---

## 📝 Principle

It is possible to **create multiple subscriptions for the same investor** thanks to the **autocomplete** function available in the subscription module.

This feature lets you **automatically reuse information already entered** in the investor record (identity, contact details, KYC status, etc.), avoiding unnecessary re-entry.

---

## ⚠️ Attention point

> ⚠️ Autocomplete is **not available** if the investor's KYC record is in **“Pending”** status.

In this case:
1. You must **wait for the current subscription to be finalized**.  
2. Once the KYC record is **validated** and the **record link is recovered**, the investor can **create a new subscription** again.

---

> 💡 This process ensures KYC data consistency and compliance for multi-fund subscriptions.
