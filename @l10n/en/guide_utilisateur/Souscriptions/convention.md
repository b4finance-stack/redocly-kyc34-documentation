## 🎯 Module objective

The B4Finance **Agreements module** lets you **manage contractual agreements** between the management company and its distributors.  
It is a **central tool** to secure, automate, and track the contracting process.

## ⚙️ General behavior

### 1️⃣ Dashboard

The **dashboard** displays the list of all existing agreements and amendments.  
It provides a synthetic view of key information:

| **Field** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **ID / Contract type** | Agreement or amendment |
| **Relevant share class** | Example: Fund 1 - Share A |
| **Contract status** | Draft, Sent, In signature, Validated |
| **Distributor** | Distributor name and completion status (“To complete”, “Approved”, etc.) |
| **Operation group** | Group linked to the agreement |
| **Distribution country** | Relevant geographical area |
| **Creation date** | Date the agreement was added to the system |

A **filtering system** lets you sort agreements:
- by **fund**, **share class**, or **distributor**,  
- by **status**: *To validate*, *Sent*, *Signed*, *Completed*, etc.

---

### 2️⃣ Create an agreement

From the **dashboard**, users can click **“Add contract”**.  
They then select:
- the **contract type**: *Agreement* or *Amendment*,  
- the **relevant fund share class**,  
- the **target distributor**.

---

### 3️⃣ Complete basic information

Before sending, users enter the **main information**:

- **Distributor contact details**  
- **Required legal information**  
- **Fund/share-related data**

Once completed, the agreement can be **sent to the distributor**.

---

### 4️⃣ Distributor interaction

The **distributor** receives the agreement through the platform and can:
- **complete missing information** (contact details, regulatory data, supporting documents),  
- **review the content**,  
- then proceed with **electronic signature** directly in the interface.

---

### 5️⃣ Tracking and validation

The **contract status** evolves automatically based on process progress:

| **Step** | **Associated status** |
|------------|-------------------|
| Contract creation | Draft |
| Sent to distributor | Sent |
| Signature in progress | In signature |
| Signature completed | Signed |
| Final verification | Validated |

Teams can:
- **monitor progress in real time**,  
- **verify signatures**,  
- **automatically archive finalized contracts**.
