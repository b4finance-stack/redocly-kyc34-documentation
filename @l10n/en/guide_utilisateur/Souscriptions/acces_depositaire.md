## 🎯 Purpose of Depositary access

**Depositary access** allows an external user, typically a **custodian bank** or a **control partner**, to **view** and **extract** **completed subscription operations**.

> 🔐 This access is **paid** and provides a **consolidated view** of validated subscriptions, with the **ability to generate related documents**.

## ⚙️ Main features

### 1️⃣ View subscriptions

The user can **filter** subscriptions using multiple criteria:

- **Fund**  
- **Share class**  
- **Signature period**  
- **Operation group**  
- ...

> 🗂️ Only **completed subscriptions** are available for consultation and extraction.

### 2️⃣ Export results

From the **options menu** (top-right of the screen), the depositary has several actions:

| **Action** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Export filtered results** | Generates a **summary table** of all subscriptions matching applied filters. |
| **Export documents** | Bulk-downloads **all documents linked** to each subscription (KYC, subscription forms, supporting files, etc.). |
