# 📊 Subscription statuses

## 🎯 Objective

This section describes the different **subscription statuses** and their implications in the user journey.  
Each status corresponds to a **key process step**, from creation by the distributor to final validation.

## 🧩 Status details

| **Status** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Draft** | The subscription is **being created** by the distributor or operator. |
| **Sent to investor** | The subscription was **sent to the investor**. <br> 👉 The operator or distributor can **take control back at any time**. |
| **Signature(s) in progress** | The **electronic signature process** is in progress. <br> ❗ At this stage, it is **no longer possible to go back**. <br> 🔧 *If changes are needed, create a new subscription.* |
| **Signature(s) completed** | All **required signers** have completed signing. |
| **In due diligence** | The **diligence file approval** step is awaiting or in progress. |
| **Validated** | The subscription has been **approved** and is now **finalized**. |

## 🧭 Additional notes

- Status transitions depend on the configured **signature workflow** in the environment.  
- Some statuses can be **automated** depending on enabled integrations (electronic signature, diligence validation, etc.).  
- Statuses are **visible in the “Subscriptions” module** and allow real-time tracking.
